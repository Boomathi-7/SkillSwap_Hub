# SkillSwap Hub
Community Skill Exchange Platform
---

SkillSwap Hub is a community-driven platform designed to enable peer-to-peer skill exchange without monetary transactions. It empowers individuals to teach what they know and learn what they need — for example, “I’ll teach you guitar if you help me with Python.” The platform promotes affordable, personalized learning through collaboration and mutual trust.

## 1. Project Overview
SkillSwap Hub addresses the high cost of personalized learning and the lack of reliable community-based exchange networks. Traditional learning platforms are often expensive and profit-driven, leaving out individuals who prefer non-monetary, skill-based exchanges. SkillSwap Hub bridges this gap by offering a reputation-driven ecosystem that connects learners and mentors directly.

**Problem Solved:** Paid learning platforms create affordability barriers, and skilled individuals lack structured opportunities to share their expertise.  

**Value Proposition:** Affordable, trust-based, and personalized skill exchange through a transparent reputation and review system.

## 2. Core Features
- **User Profiles:** Users list the skills they can offer and the skills they want to learn.  
- **Skill Search & Filter:** Enables users to find matching mentors or learners quickly.  
- **Direct Messaging:** Built-in chat feature for scheduling and coordination.  
- **Project Completion & Reviews:** Mandatory feedback and star ratings after each exchange to ensure quality.  
- **Reputation System:** Tracks user reliability and experience to build trust across the community.
